# Accenture-x-PSA-Challenge

Business Data Management 
Class Note


I.	2021.04.16 Friday-Class 3 Session 1: Architecting the Data
1.	Project deadline and further plans

2.	The purpose of the project
-	Bypassing the loss of tracked data with GDPR regulation evolving with respect to cookies to track
-	You will get nothing since users are able to refuse all

3.	What KPI needs to be estimated? 
 
-	KPIs which compare the sessions before/after the GDPR

4.	Data Exploration Review - Groups Review
(1)	Methodology
-	Insights part is missing for most groups
-	Don’t load the whole dataset at once
-	Focus on local market (France)
-	Make your legends clear for visualization
-	Make the best of ‘product’ table, of which you can find the quantity and categories of the purchase.
-	Trying to correlate two variables is a good practice. Try doing such correlations on data from multiple tables.
-	Pay attention to a granularity of the data - different groups got different data from same metrics.
-	Take the business side into consideration
Ex. You need to go online to get information after covid cadence. 
(2)	Examples
(3)	Q&A
-	When analyzing a graph and you see for example that the activity on the website has changed after the lockdown or because of a specific event. Okay and after that what you're asking is to simply dig deeper?
→ Do we find the same pattern compared to the last year? Yes, but with different proportion 

5.	Best Practices for Data analyst/Scientist
-	Always keep openmind without biases

6.	Data Exploration
-	Bounce rate: those who leave the website without doing anything 

 
→ After quarantine, the number of visit recovered 
-	The end goal here is to define the session!

7.	Advanced Behavior Analysis
(1)	Number of session by Source of Traffic
 

(2)	 Conclusion
-	Most of traffic is coming from direct sources, most of users have an appetency for PSA when coming to the website
-	The behavior from direct sources lead to more active sessions with more page views that last longer
-	The users from direct sources will not end up looking at a car page every time they come but may look to other products and accessories


7. Correlation Analysis
-	Avg time during session vs. number pageviews
-	The size of point = number of session concerned in the plot

8. Final Data Set
(1)	KPIs & Features definitions Products
(2)	KPIs & Features definitions Details & Forms

9. Hackathon
-	All groups will be given the same data set.
-	The presentation + the quality of algorithm will decide the grades


II.	2021.04.16 Friday-Class 3 Session 2: Architecting the Data
1.	Segmentation Objectives
-	Make the algorithm usable for business purpose and explainable for non-business users.
 

2.	Lab Session
 
 

3.	Guideline
-	Make sure the visualizations are readable (legends) with comments and analysis
-	Close the gap between presentation and the codes
